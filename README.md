# telegram-redirect
This project creates a smart redirect system that detects whether a link is opened via Telegram and applies a 10-second time offset before redirecting to any target URL. Itâ€™s designed to showcase Telegram-specific behavior and can be used for analytics, tracking, or custom routing.
